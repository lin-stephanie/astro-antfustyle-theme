### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- **style:** Ensure responsive alignment for social sections on `/` ([4b567c0](https://github.com/lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme/commit/4b567c0))
- :::details
  ::summary[**rss:** Resolve MDX post parsing error ([c9ef3f2](https://github.com/lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme/commit/c9ef3f2))]
  - Fixes an error due to missing `compiledContent()` method on item in MDX, which cannot be invoked
  - Omit generating the `content` field directly (as it includes unprocessed special syntax, making its generation unnecessary)
