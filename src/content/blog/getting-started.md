This post outlines the essential steps to quickly set up your personal website using the [Astro AntfuStyle Theme](https://github.com/lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme). Each step may involve more detailed content, requiring you to consult other posts for further information.

## Preparation

(_Skip if you’re a developer_) To build your website with this theme, it's recommended to:

- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for running and developing the project locally.
- [Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) for managing dependencies.
- [Configure Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) for version control.
- [Register on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) for cloud hosting.
- [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for code editing. [Set up Git and sign in to GitHub](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_set-up-git-in-vs-code).
- Familiarity with [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) and [basic front-end knowledge](https://medium.com/swlh/web-development-fundamentals-for-newcomers-part-1-front-end-2e77f830754e) is a plus.

These are ideal conditions, but feel free to substitute with tools you're comfortable with.

## Create Your Project

Start with the latest theme version using one of two methods:

**Use GitHub**

Create a new repository in your GitHub account by clicking ["Use this template"](https://github.com/new?template_name=astro-antfustyle-theme&template_owner=lin-stephanie) (without commit history) or ["Fork"](https://github.com/lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme/fork) (preserves commit history) , then clone it locally:

```bash
# If SSH is not configured
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO_NAME].git

# If SSH is configured
git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO_NAME].git
```

**Use CLI**

Run the following commands in your desired directory to start locally:

```bash
# npm 6.x
npm create astro@latest --template lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed
npm create astro@latest -- --template lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme

# yarn
yarn create astro --template lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme

# pnpm
pnpm dlx create-astro --template lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme
```

> [!tip]- Using zip files instead of Git
>
> If you prefer not to use Git, you can [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/lin-stephanie/astro-antfustyle-theme/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract it, and work directly in your local directory.

## Launch the Project

Start the project by running the following commands from the project root (replace `pnpm` with your preferred package manager if needed):

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the local dev server (opens at 'http://localhost:4321')
pnpm dev
```

> [!warning]- Astro shows the dev server address after data sync
> 
> When running `pnpm dev`, Astro loads external data (e.g. via loaders) and syncs content before starting the dev server, which may cause a slight delay depending on network conditions and data size.

You can explore the current theme freely. Additionally, the following commands are available:

| Command                                     | Description                                                                                                                 |

> [!warning]- GitHub PAT required for `/releases` and `/prs` pages
> 
> If no GitHub PAT is set, a warning appears in the console after running `pnpm dev`.  
>
> To remove these pages, see [Removing Pages](../recreating-current-pages/#removing-pages).  
>
> To show GitHub activity, see [Customizing GitHub Activity Pages](../customizing-github-activity-pages/).  

> [!tip]- Using `pnpm` or switching to another package manager
> 
> This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager, so you’ll need to install it if you haven’t yet. You can execute `npm install -g pnpm` to [install `pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) globally. 
> 
> Alternatively, you can [enable `corepack`](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) (allows you to manage package manager versions directly via Node.js) or [install the `ni` tool](https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni) (simplifies running commands across different package managers).
>
> If you want to use a different package manager, make sure to [convert the project to your chosen package manager](../faqs-and-known-issues/#revert-from-pnpm-to-npm-or-yarn) before running its commands.

## Configure the Project
